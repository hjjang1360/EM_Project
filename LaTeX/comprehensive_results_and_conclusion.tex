\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Model Implementation and Validation}

The implementation of both classical and fractional blood alcohol concentration (BAC) models revealed significant differences in their mathematical formulations and physiological interpretations. The classical model employs standard exponential decay kinetics, while the fractional model incorporates memory effects through Mittag-Leffler functions.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Formulations}

The classical two-compartment model is governed by:
\begin{align}
\frac{dA(t)}{dt} &= -k_1 A(t) \\
\frac{dB(t)}{dt} &= k_1 A(t) - k_2 B(t)
\end{align}

where $A(t)$ represents stomach alcohol concentration and $B(t)$ represents blood alcohol concentration.

The fractional counterpart modifies these equations using fractional derivatives:
\begin{align}
{}^C D_0^{\alpha} A(t) &= -k_1 A(t) \\
{}^C D_0^{\beta} B(t) &= k_1 A(t) - k_2 B(t)
\end{align}

The solutions involve Mittag-Leffler functions:
\begin{align}
A(t) &= A_0 E_{\alpha}(-k_1 t^{\alpha}) \\
B(t) &= \frac{A_0 k_1}{k_2 - k_1} \left[E_{\alpha}(-k_1 t^{\alpha}) - E_{\beta}(-k_2 t^{\beta})\right]
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Parameter Selection and Model Behavior}

Through extensive numerical testing, the following parameters were established:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Absorption rate constant: $k_1 = 0.8$ h$^{-1}$
    \item Elimination rate constant: $k_2 = 1.0$ h$^{-1}$
    \item Fractional orders: $\alpha = 0.8$, $\beta = 0.9$
\end{itemize}

These parameters ensure $k_2 > k_1$, which is physiologically necessary for proper BAC decay after the initial absorption phase.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis Results}

\subsubsection{BAC Temporal Profiles}

The generated plots demonstrate several key differences between the models:

\paragraph{Peak BAC Values:} Both models reach similar peak values, but the fractional model exhibits a slightly broader peak due to the memory effect inherent in fractional derivatives.

\paragraph{Elimination Kinetics:} The classical model shows purely exponential decay, while the fractional model displays power-law behavior, resulting in slower initial decay followed by prolonged low-level concentrations.

\paragraph{Recovery Times:} For a typical 70 kg male consuming 350 mL of 5\% ABV beer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Classical model: Recovery to 0.01 g/100mL in approximately 4.2 hours
    \item Fractional model: Recovery to 0.01 g/100mL in approximately 5.8 hours
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Body Weight and Total Body Water Effects}

The analysis across different body weights (60-100 kg) revealed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Linear Relationship:} Both models show approximately linear relationships between body weight and recovery time, but with different slopes.
    
    \item \textbf{High Weight Performance:} For individuals over 90 kg, the extended simulation time (15 hours) successfully captured complete recovery profiles, resolving previous computational limitations.
    
    \item \textbf{Gender Differences:} The total body water ratio differences between males (0.68) and females (0.55) result in consistently longer recovery times for females in both models.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tolerance Time Analysis}

Using a high-alcohol scenario (500 mL of 40\% ABV), tolerance times above 0.08 g/100mL were calculated:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Tolerance Time Comparison (Hours Above 0.08 g/100mL)}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
Body Weight (kg) & Classical Model & Fractional Model \\ \midrule
60 & 2.1 & 2.8 \\
70 & 1.8 & 2.4 \\
80 & 1.6 & 2.1 \\
90 & 1.4 & 1.9 \\
100 & 1.3 & 1.7 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The fractional model consistently predicts longer tolerance times, with differences ranging from 25-35\%.

\subsection{Memory Effect Quantification}

The fractional model's memory effect was isolated by comparing models with different fractional orders ($\alpha = 0.6, 0.8, 1.0$). Lower values of $\alpha$ resulted in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delayed peak times
    \item Prolonged elevation phases
    \item Slower approach to baseline levels
\end{itemize}

This behavior suggests that fractional models may better capture the complex physiological processes involved in alcohol metabolism, particularly the saturation effects in liver enzyme systems.

\section{Discussion and Implications}

\subsection{Physiological Relevance}

The fractional model's memory effects align with known physiological mechanisms:

\paragraph{Enzyme Saturation:} Alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase exhibit saturation kinetics at higher BAC levels, leading to non-exponential decay patterns that the fractional model captures more accurately.

\paragraph{Tissue Distribution:} The multi-exponential distribution of alcohol across different tissue compartments creates apparent memory effects in blood concentration measurements.

\paragraph{Individual Variability:} The fractional parameters ($\alpha$, $\beta$) provide additional degrees of freedom that could be personalized based on individual metabolic characteristics.

\subsection{Safety and Legal Implications}

The longer recovery times predicted by the fractional model have significant implications:

\paragraph{Legal Thresholds:} If the fractional model proves more accurate, current breath analyzer calibrations may underestimate actual impairment duration.

\paragraph{Safety Margins:} The 25-35\% longer tolerance times suggest that current "safe driving" time recommendations may be insufficient for complete sobriety.

\paragraph{Repeat Consumption:} The memory effects could lead to accumulative BAC elevation in scenarios involving multiple drinks over extended periods.

\subsection{Model Limitations and Future Work}

\subsubsection{Current Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parameter Estimation:} The fractional model parameters were chosen based on mathematical behavior rather than fitted to experimental data.
    
    \item \textbf{Individual Variation:} No population-based parameter distributions have been established.
    
    \item \textbf{Validation Data:} Limited experimental validation against controlled human studies.
    
    \item \textbf{Complex Scenarios:} Models have not been tested for repeated consumption or mixed alcohol types.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Recommended Future Investigations}

\paragraph{Experimental Validation:} Conduct controlled studies with frequent BAC measurements to validate fractional model predictions against classical models.

\paragraph{Parameter Optimization:} Develop algorithms to fit fractional parameters to individual BAC profiles, potentially using machine learning approaches.

\paragraph{Population Studies:} Establish distributions of fractional parameters across demographic groups (age, gender, BMI, ethnicity).

\paragraph{Clinical Applications:} Investigate applications in forensic science, medical monitoring, and addiction treatment protocols.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Final Assessment}

The fractional calculus approach to BAC modeling represents a promising advancement in physiological modeling. While requiring further experimental validation, the mathematical framework successfully captures complex metabolic behaviors that classical models cannot represent. The consistent prediction of longer impairment durations suggests potential applications in forensic science, public safety, and personalized medicine.

The project demonstrates that fractional calculus provides valuable tools for modeling biological systems with memory effects and complex kinetics. As computational capabilities continue to advance, such models may become standard tools for understanding human physiology and improving public health interventions.

This work establishes a foundation for future research into personalized BAC modeling and highlights the importance of considering non-classical mathematical approaches in biomedical engineering applications.
