	abstract = {This paper deals with fractional diﬀerential equations, with dependence on a Caputo fractional derivative of real order. The goal is to show, based on concrete examples and experimental data from several experiments, that fractional diﬀerential equations may model more eﬃciently certain problems than ordinary diﬀerential equations. A numerical optimization approach based on least squares approximation is used to determine the order of the fractional operator that better describes real data, as well as other related parameters.},
